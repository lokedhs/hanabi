## Usage & configuration

You must add (and fill) the following to your `config/config.exs` file :

```
config :hanabi, port: 6667,
                hostname: "my.awesome.hostname",
                motd: "/path/to/motd.txt"
```

You only have to add `hanabi` in the dependency section of your `mix.exs` file.
You can start it with `Hanabi.start/0` or `Hanabi.start/2`.
